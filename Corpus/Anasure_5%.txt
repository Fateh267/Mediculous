Anasure 5% Solution belongs to a class of drugs known as vasodilators. It is used to promote hair growth after hereditary hair loss (male pattern baldness). It is not used for sudden, patchy or unexplained hair loss.Anasure 5% Solution should only be applied directly to the scalp area in the amount, and in the way, specified on the label or by your doctor. Clean and dry your scalp before using it. It may take several months before you notice any hair growth and the first growth may be soft, colourless and barely visible. Using more than recommended will not speed up hair growth and may cause dangerous side effects. This medication must be used continuously to maintain hair growth. If your condition does not improve or worsens after using it for 4 to 6 months, tell your doctor.Anasure 5% Solution is generally safe and suitable for most people but may have some potential side effects. The most common are itching or irritation of the scalp and unwanted hair growth in other places (not your scalp). It may also make you feel unwell and change the color and texture of your hair. If this happens, inform your doctor. If this medicine gets into the bloodstream it can cause side effects related to low blood pressure such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat and dizziness, swollen hands and feet. This should not happen if you use it correctly and avoid contact with broken skin. If you get it in your eyes, mouth or broken skin, rinse thoroughly with plenty of water. Talk to your doctor if youÂ are bothered by side effects or they do not go away.Anasure 5% Solution should not normally be used by people under the age of 18 or over 65. It may not be appropriate if your hair loss is due to medications (such as chemotherapy) or any nutritional deficiency.

Talk to your doctor if you have heart disease or blood circulation problems.
