Abhayrab Vaccine is given to people who are at higher risk of coming in contact with rabies like veterinarians. It is also given to people after an animal bite if the animal could have rabies. If the vaccine is given immediately and appropriately, it is 100 percent effective.Abhayrab Vaccine is given by injection by a doctor or nurse. It is administered post thorough washing (for about 15 minutes, with soap and copious amounts of water) of all bite wounds as early as possible. The sooner treatment is begun after exposure, the better. Post-exposure anti rabies vaccination should always include administration of both Immunoglobulin and vaccine, with the exception of persons who have previously received complete vaccination regimens. It is very very important to complete the course of the vaccine to prevent this fatal disease.The most common side effects include pain, joint pain, Injection site redness, and swelling. They do not normally last very long. Sitting or lying down can sometimes help. Consult your doctor if any of the side effects persist or worry you.Before having the injection, you should tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine. Some other medicines may react with the rabies vaccine so talk to your doctor about other medications you are taking as well. You should consult your doctor first if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
