Adacin Gel is a combination of two medicines that effectively treats acne. It minimizes oil production and helps to reduce inflammation. It also kills acne-causing microorganisms and prevents infection. This helps to prevent pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads on the skin.Adacin Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor.  You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away. Inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines), or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
