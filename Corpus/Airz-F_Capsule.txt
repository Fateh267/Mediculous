Airz-F Capsule is a combination of two medicines that makes breathing easier for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by stopping the release of certain chemical messengers that cause inflammation (swelling), thus relaxing the muscles in the airways.Your doctor will tell you how often you need to use your inhaler. It’s important that you take the lowest dose needed to effectively control your asthma. The effect of this medicine may be noticeable after a few days but will only reach its maximum after a few weeks. This medicine must be used regularly to be effective, so go on taking it even if you don't have any symptoms. That means it’s doing its job. If you stop taking it your asthma may get worse. It should not be used to relieve sudden asthma attacks. If an asthma attack occurs, use your quick-relief inhaler (reliever). The most common side effects are indigestion, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the throat and nasal passages), chest pain, fever, sore throat, cough, headache, sinus inflammation, inflammation of the nose, and urinary tract infection. If you get these symptoms, don’t stop taking it but do talk to your doctor. You can help prevent these symptoms by rinsing your mouth and throat with water or brushing your teeth after using your inhaler. In general, you should be trying to avoid situations that make your asthma worse (your triggers) and try not to smoke.Before taking Airz-F Capsule, you should tell your doctor if you have any infections in your mouth or lungs, and liver or kidney disease. Ask your doctor whether it’s safe to take this medicine if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.
